# Governance in 💫Grewety Creative Space

This document outlines the governance model for **💫Grewety**. This includes detailed descriptions of different roles,
nomination processes, code review processes, and [Code of Conduct][coc] enforcement.

> 👉 **All community members must follow the [Code of Conduct (CoC)][coc].**  
> Consequences for CoC violations are detailed in [Moderation](#moderation).

> 👉 **Want to trigger a vote, nomination, or perform some other action?**  
> Scroll down to [Playbook](#governance-playbook).

## Get Involved

**Anything that supports the 💫Grewety community is a valuable contribution!**

All types of contribution are meaningful. This can include code changes, type fixes, [Discord][discord] activity, and
even posting about **💫Grewety** to your personal blog. No contribution is too small!

Anyone can become a **💫Grewety** contributor (yes, even you🖐️). Engineering ability is not required. Our goal is to
recognize all contributors to the project regardless of skill, experience or background.

## Community Roles

We recognize different types of contribution as five different **Community Roles**. Because each Community Role comes
with a new set of privileges and responsibilities, you may also see these roles as gratitude.

> ✨ **More on this topic**: [Generating a culture of recognition and gratitude in teams][kudo]

Community Roles are available to **all members** of the **💫Grewety** community, regardless of coding skill or
experience.

Two important things that we look for in a contributor are:

- **Being here**: Everyone's time is valuable, and the fact that you're here and contributing to **💫Grewety** is
  amazing! Thank
  you for being a part of this project with us.
- **Being a positive member of our community**: Go above and beyond our [Code of Conduct][coc] and commit to healthy
  communication across pull requests, issue discussions, [Discord][discord] conversations, and any interactions outside
  our community (e.g. no Twitter bullies allowed 😑)

All Community Roles are granted for as long as the individual wishes to engage with **💫Grewety**.

Contributors can voluntarily leave the project at any time. See [🦖Alumni](#alumni) below for
more information.

In extreme cases ‒ such as a [Code of Conduct][coc] violation ‒ a role may be revoked by a 👮Project Steward at their
discretion.

Each new contributor involvement unlocks new privileges and responsibilities both on [Discord][discord] and on GitHub.
Below is a summary of each role.

The **🥈Maintainer** role is available to contributors who want to join the team and take part in the long-term
maintenance and growth of **💫Grewety**.

The 🥈Maintainer role is critical to the long-term health of **💫Grewety**. 🥈Maintainers act as the first line of defense
when it comes to new issues and user requests, pull requests (PR) and [Discord][discord] activity. 🥈Maintainers are
most likely the first people that a user will interact with on [Discord][discord] or GitHub.

**🥈Maintainers are not required to write code!** Some 🥈Maintainers spend most of their time inside
of [Discord][discord], maintaining a healthy community there. Others work on technical documentation, support, or
design.

**A 🥈Maintainer has the opportunity for optional [🚩Moderator Role](#moderator-role).** All maintainers are trusted
with the ability to help moderate our [Discord][discord] and GitHub communities when a community member reaches out
for moderation help.

**A 🥈Maintainer has the opportunity for participation in the
[🤩User Satisfaction Committee Working Group](#user-satisfaction-committee-usc)**. Due to this involvement in the
community and the project insigts about the users needs are valuable for the future and prosperity of **💫Grewety**.

#### Recognized Contributions (Examples)

### 🥇Core Member

The **🥇Core Member** role is available to community members who have a larger-than-usual impact on the **💫Grewety**
project and community. They are seen as leaders in the project and are listened to by the wider **💫Grewety**
community, often before they have even reached this reputation. A Member is recognized for contributing a significant
amount of time and energy to the project through solving issues, pull requests and RFCs, bug fixes, implementing
advanced enhancements/features, gathering user feedback, creating documentation and tutorials and/or actively
posting on [Discord][discord].

Not every 🥉Contributor Role will graduate to this role, and that's okay! 🥈Maintainers still have significant
responsibility and privileges within our community, e.g. participation in the
[🤩User Satisfaction Committee Working Group](#user-satisfaction-committee-usc) and influencing the roadmap of the
**💫Grewety** project.

#### Privileges

- All privileges of the [🥈Maintainer Role](#maintainer), plus...
- Invitation to the new `@coremember` role on [Discord][discord].
- New color on [Discord][discord]: **🥇gold**

- You can be nominated by any existing 🥇Core Member.
- A nomination thread will be created in [Discord][discord] `#coremembers` channel (the private channel for all
  🥇Core Member) with your nomination ‒ with or without your awareness.
- Once nominated, [voting for a new 🥇Core Member](#voting-new-core-member) is initiated.
- The nomination is limited for three (3) years before a renomination have to take place.

### 🪅Committed Member

**🪅Committed Member** is by default a time-limited special designation for anyone who has been brought in to work on or
contribute to the **💫Grewety** project on behalf of 🥇Core Members without rising through our normal contributor stages.
For example: a **💫Grewety** designer or developer advocate hired to assist the community could be nominated for a
🪅Committed Member role without having a previously earned 🥉Bronze Contributor Kudo.

#### Privileges

- `@committed` role on [Discord][discord].
- New name color on Discord: **🪅yellow**
- Invitation to `#coremembers` channel on [Discord][discord], at the discretion of the 👮Project Steward.
- Invitation to the `committed` team on GitHub.

A 🪅Committed Member is still eligible for other roles in the community and may still vote as defined by their
other roles.

#### Limitations

🪅Committed Members does not grant any abilities when it comes to voting and project governance.

- No voting abilities.
- No nomination abilities.
- Can be revoked at any time by the 👮Project Steward or a vote by the 🥇Core Members with an overwhelming majority
  (70%+).
- Limited for six (6) months, unless otherwise specified in the nomination. After this period, a new nomination must be
  made.

#### Nomination Process to Committed Member

A 🪅Committed Member nomination must still be approved through the normal 🥇Core Member nomination and voting process.
During the nomination, the 👮Project Steward will state that the nomination is for the 🪅Committed Member designation.

The 👮Project Steward is the only one who can officially make this designation during the nomination process.

A 🪅Committed Member can become a full 🥇Core Member (with all limitations removed) through the normal 🥇Core Member
nomination and voting procedure.

If a 🪅Committed Member has their membership revoked, the 👮Project Steward may choose to impose a waiting period of
some number of days, during which the member can not be re-nominated to become a 🥇Core Member.

### 🦖Alumni

**🦖Alumni** is a special designation for at least a 🥈Maintainers who have stepped away from the project and no longer
contribute regularly.

Community Roles are granted for as long as the person wishes to engage with the project. However, over time an active
community member may choose to step away from the **💫Grewety** project to work on other things. Moving on from a project
is a natural and well-understood part of any open source community, and we celebrate it!

As a 🥈Maintainer you can retire your role at any time by pinging the 👮Project Steward and requesting 🦖Alumni
status. You can initiate this action yourself if you know ahead-of-time that you need to step away from the project. Or,
if you have gone several months without interacting with the **💫Grewety** community, the 👮Project Steward may actively
reach out to you to discuss retiring as a way to make room for new contributors.

#### Privileges

By retiring and joining 🦖Alumni you trade in your current set of roles, privileges, and responsibilities for a new,
special 🦖Alumni role, which comes with its own set of privileges:

- `@alumni` role on [Discord][discord].
- New name color on Discord: **🦖light green**.
- Invitation to the private `#alumni` channel on [Discord][discord].

#### Rejoining

As an 🦖Alumni member, you are still a part of the **💫Grewety** community and can continue to be a part of
our [Discord][discord], GitHub, and anywhere else. You may also request to have your old roles reinstated at any
time through the normal nomination & voting process for that role.

Rejoining the project as a 🥉Contributor will automatically remove you from the 🦖Alumni role.

### Additional Roles

Few Community Roles can have additional roles with additional responsibilities and delegated duties as described next.

#### 🚩Moderator Role

**Moderator** is a special role available to [🥈Maintainer Role](#maintainer). While all maintainers are
granted permissions to moderate for bad behavior across our community, a Moderator actively takes on this the
responsibility. For example, a community member may ping moderators (via the `@moderator` role) to resolve spam posts or
[Code of Conduct][coc] violations.

Trivial tasks (like removing spam) can be acted on unilaterally by a Moderator. Other non-trivial tasks (like assisting
with or resolving a [Code of Conduct][coc] violation) should involve the entire Moderator team (and in some cases, the
👮Project Steward).

##### Privileges

- `@mods` role on [Discord][discord].
- Invitation to the private `#mods` channel on [Discord][discord].
- Invitation to the `mods` team on GitHub.

##### Nomination

Any at least [🥈Maintainer](#maintainer) can self-nominate by messaging the 👮Project Steward
(`@steward`) on [Discord][discord].

#### 👮Project Steward

The **👮Project Steward** is an additional role bestowed to 1 (or more) 🥇Core Member of the project.

The role of 👮️Project Steward is mainly an administrative one. 👮Project Stewards control and maintain sensitive
project assets, assist in resolving conflicts, and act as tiebreakers in the event of disagreements.

In extremely rare cases, a 👮Project Steward can act unilaterally when they believe it is in the project's best
interest and can prove that the issue cannot be resolved through normal governance procedure. The 👮Project Steward
must publicly state their reason for unilateral action before taking it.

##### Responsibilities

- Invitation to the new `@steward` role on [Discord][discord].
- Establish [Code of Conduct][coc].
- Bears the 💰costs of the **💫Grewety** services.
- Ensuring and maintaining the availability of the **💫Grewety** services.
- Leadership and sincere interest in the welfare of **💫Grewety** community.
- Ability to initiate a [vote](#voting).
- Ability to veto [votes](#voting) and resolve voting deadlocks.
- Define project direction and planning, preferably by RFC.
- Ability to decide on [moderation](#moderation) decisions.
- Administration privileges on the [Grewety GitHub.org][github].
- Administration privileges on the [Grewety Discord server][discord].
- Publish access to the [Grewety npmjs account][npmjs].
- Domain registrar and DNS access to https://grewety.com, and all other subdomains.
- Access to the `*@grewety.com` email address.

##### Nomination Process for a Project Steward

- 👮Project Steward cannot nominate themselves, except for the founder [**Raphael Bossek**][rbo] aka _@hephaistos_DE_.
- Only 🥇Core Members are eligible.
- New 👮Project Steward will be added based on a unanimous vote by the existing 👮Project Steward(s).
- In the event that someone is unreachable then the decision will be deferred.

## Working Groups

Besides our Community Roles described above, there are **Working Groups** available that community members
are welcome to join. Working Groups are a great way to organize around different projects and initiatives in our
community. For example:

- 📒Editor Working Group runs the `#docs` [Discord][discord] channel and organizes the growth and development of
  **💫Grewety** documentation and tutorials.
- 🎓Supporter Working Group runs the `#support` [Discord][discord] channel and helps anyone who needs help using
  **💫Grewety**.
- 🌏Translator Working Group runs the `#i18n` [Discord][discord] channel and organizes translations in several languages.

Many of these Working Groups can be joined by the first contribution in the corresponding channel on
[Discord][discord]. Getting involved with a Working Group is a great way to start contributing to **💫Grewety**.

### 🤩User Satisfaction Committee (USC)

The **🤩USC** is a special Working Group available to 🥈Maintainers and 🥇Core Members. Their duty is to ensure that the
needs of **💫Grewety** users are taken into account and that future necessary changes are identified at an early
stage and recorded in the form of RFCs. Satisfied users is the goal.

A 🤩USC Working Group member takes care of the needs of the users and is convinced that the continuity of the
**💫Grewety** project can only be ensured if the needs of the users can be satisfied. He draws his knowledge from
handling `#support` questions, creating guidance on relevant use cases, getting feedback from users in
[Discord][discord] and elsewhere. Any form of interaction within and especially outside the community are important
and valuable sources of inspiration. This make the participation in the `#support` and `#docs` Working Groups so
relevant and valuable.

#### Privileges

- `@usc` role on [Discord][discord].
- Invitation to the private `#usc` channel on [Discord][discord].
- Invitation to the `usc` team on GitHub.
- Ability to vote on RFCs (see [vote rules & requirements](#voting) below).

#### Responsibilities

- Participating in RFC discussions and user conversations on [Discord][discord], especially in `#support` channel.
- Gathering information about user needs and create meaningfully RFCs.
- Creating und publishing of helpful tutorials for new users and **💫Grewety** veterans based on needs and trends.

#### Nomination

- To be nominated, a nominee is expected to already be active in strategical roadmap discussions and performing some
  of the responsibilities of a 🤩USC member.
- You can be nominated by any existing 🥈Maintainers and 🥇Core Members. Note: This includes all existing 🤩USC members
  as well.
- Once nominated, there will be a vote by existing 🥈Maintainers and 🥇Core Members.
- See [vote rules & requirements](#voting) for info on how this vote works.

### 💎Technical Excellence Committee (TEC)

The **💎TEC** is a special role available to 🥇Core Members. 💎TEC members are responsible for the technical excellence
and reliability of the **💫Grewety** projects.

💎TEC members are technical guardians over the **💫Grewety** projects. Their duty is to ensure code maintainability,
technical documentation, correctness and security.

💎TEC members are ultimately responsible for technical decision-making when it comes to any compatibility breaking
changes to the **💫Grewety** projects.

A 💎TEC member has significant sway in software design decisions. For this reason, coding experience is critical for this
role. 💎TEC membership is one of the few roles that requires a significant contribution history of code to the
**💫Grewety** project on GitHub.

#### Privileges

- `@tec` role on [Discord][discord].
- Invitation to the private `#tec` channel on [Discord][discord].
- Invitation to the `tec` team on GitHub.
- Ability to merge all GitHub pull requests (PRs).
- Ability to vote on RFCs and technical initiatives (see [vote rules & requirements](#voting) below).

#### Responsibilities

- Participating in RFC discussions and technical meetings.
- Assisting with design and implementation of non-trivial GitHub pull requests (PRs).
- Reviewing and merging larger, non-trivial pull requests (PRs).
- Maintaining and improving overall codebase architecture.
- Tracking and ensuring progress of open pull requests.
- Mentoring and guiding other community contributors.

#### Nomination

- To be nominated, a nominee is expected to already be active in technical discussions and performing some of the
  responsibilities of a 💎TEC member.
- You can be nominated by any existing 🥇Core Members. Note: This includes all existing 💎TEC members as well.
- Once nominated, there will be a vote by existing 🥇Core Members.
- See [vote rules & requirements](#voting) for info on how this vote works.

# Governance Playbook

## Decision-Making Process

Changes for **💫Grewety** projects are discussed using a model called [Consensus-seeking decision-making]
[consensus-seeking]. This model attempts to achieve consensus on all changes to **💫Grewety**, but has a fallback voting
procedure in place if consensus appears unattainable.

> ✨ **More on this topic**: Read more
> about [Consensus Decision-Making](https://thedecider.app/consensus-decision-making)
> approach and the process itself, its pros and cons and how to avoid common pitfalls. There is a more detailed
> guide to [Consent Decision-Making](https://patterns.sociocracy30.org/consent-decision-making.html) for 👮Project
> Steward, the facilitators of the decision-making process.

**If consensus still cannot be reached**, the 👮Project Steward may change
the [decision-making model][decision-making-models] even continue with [rough consensus][rough-consensus] to resolve
a deadlock in the process that has not achieved absolute consensus, as described below (borrowed from the
[IETF][rfc2418]):

> Working groups make decisions through a "rough consensus" process. **💫Grewety** consensus does not require
> that all participants agree although this is, of course, preferred. In general, the dominant view of the working
> group, e.g. 🤩USC and 💎TEC for RFCs, shall prevail. (However, "dominance" is not to be determined on the basis of
> volume or persistence, but rather a more general sense of agreement). Consensus can be determined by a show of hands,
> humming, or any other means on which the working group agrees (by rough consensus, of course). Note that working
> group of the TSC does not qualify as "rough consensus" and 99% is better than rough. It is up to the 👮Project Steward
> to determine if rough consensus has been reached.

## Voting

Certain project decisions (like governance changes and membership nominations) require a vote. Below are the changes
that require a vote, and the rules that govern that vote.

The 👮Project Steward may initiate a vote for any unlisted project decision.
[General Voting Rules](#general-voting-rules) will apply, along with any addition rules provided at the 👮Project
Steward's discretion. If this unlisted project decision is expected to be repeated in the future, voting rules
should be agreed on and then added to this document.

### General Voting Rules

- Members may abstain from any vote.
- Members who do not vote within 3 days will automatically abstain.
- 👮Project Stewards may reduce the 3 days automatic abstain for urgent decisions.
- 👮Project Stewards reserve the right to veto approval with a publicly disclosed reason.

### Voting: New 🥈Maintainer

> 💡 **Note**: This process kicks off once a valid nomination has been made.
> See [Nomination Process to a Maintainer](#nomination-process-to-maintainer) above for more
> details on nomination.

> ⚖️ **Who can vote:** Any 🥈Maintainer, 🥇Core Member can participate in the vote thread after a valid nomination has
> been made.

   feedback.
   > 💡 **Note**: This is not required if the nominee was not made aware of their nomination.

### Voting: New 🥇Core Member

> 💡 **Note**: This process kicks off once a valid nomination has been made.

   > 💡 **Note**: This is not required if the nominee was not made aware of their nomination.

### Voting: Governance Change

A vote is initiated once a pull request (PR) to the `GOVERNANCE.md` file is submitted by a 🥇Core Member.

If the pull request (PR) submitter is not a 🥇Core Member, the pull request (PR) can be closed by any 🥈Maintainer
without a vote. However, any 🥇Core Member may request a vote on that pull request (PR), in which case a vote is
initiated.

> ⚖️ **Who can vote:** Any 🥇Core Member.

> 💡 **Note**: All 🥈Maintainers are encouraged to discuss and voice their opinion in the
> pull request (PR) discussion. 🥇Core Members should take the opinions of 🥈Maintainers into consideration when voting.

1. The pull request discussion thread is used to discuss the Governance Change.
2. The normal 3 day voting & discussion window begins with either the pull request (PR) creation or the removal of
   `WIP:` from the pull request (PR) title if the pull request (PR) was created as a draft.
3. Voting can be done in the pull request via a review of either **Approve (For)** or **Change Requested (Against)**.
4. The vote must receive a simple majority (50%+) to pass.
5. **If the vote passes**: the pull request (PR) is merged and the changes take effect immediately.
6. **If the vote fails**: the pull request (PR) is closed and no change occurs.

### Voting: Request for Change (RFC) Proposals

Introduction of new features, removal or incompatible change of existing features in **💫Grewety** are discussed using a
model called [Consensus-seeking decision-making][consensus-seeking]. This model attempts to achieve consensus on all
significant changes to **💫Grewety**, but has a fallback voting procedure in place if consensus appears unattainable.

> ⚖️ **Who can vote:** All [🤩USC](#user-satisfaction-committee-usc) and [💎TEC](#technical-excellence-committee-tec)
> members.

1. Anyone can submit an RFC to suggest changes to **💫Grewety**.
2. Scope of change: trivial changes and obvious improvements
    - A _trivial_ technical change can be discussed and approved entirely within the RFC GitHub issue, as long as
      there are no objections from 💎TEC members. This is not considered a formal vote.
    - An _obvious_ improvement of the user satisfaction can be discussed and approved entirely with the RFC GitHub, as
      long as there are objections from 🤩USC members.
3. A non-trivial, significant change should be discussed within the RFC and **approved during an RFC meeting call**. In
   some cases, an RFC may be approved outside an RFC meeting using pull request (PR) reviews as a proxy for votes.
4. During an RFC meeting, the person leading the call will attempt to achieve a [decision](#decision-making-process)
   on the RFC proposal.
5. **If consensus is reached**: the RFC is approved.
6. **If consensus is not reached**: The RFC author, the 🤩USC and 💎TEC members must make all reasonable attempts to
   resolve issues and reach a decision in GitHub or a follow-up RFC meeting. The process of reaching can take time, and
   should not be rushed as long as all participants are making a reasonable effort to respond.
7. **If consensus still cannot be reached**: The 👮Project Steward may invoke [rough consensus][rough-consensus] or
   choose any [other decision-making model](#decision-making-process) to resolve an RFC that has not achieved absolute
   consensus.

## Moderation

Outlined below is the process for [Code of Conduct][coc] violation reviews.

### Reporting

Anyone may report a [Code of Conduct][coc] violation. Violations can be reported in the following ways:

- In private, via email to one or more 👮Project Stewards.
- In private, via direct message to a 👮Project Steward on [Discord][discord].
- In public, via a GitHub comment (mentioning `grewety/@maintainers`).
- In public, via the project [Discord][discord] server (mentioning `@steward`).

### Who gets involved?

Each report will be assigned reviewers. These will initially be all project 👮Project Stewards.

In the event of any conflict of interest - in example if 👮Project Stewards who are personally connected to a
situation, they must immediately recuse themselves.

At request of the reporter and if deemed appropriate by the reviewers, another neutral third-party may be involved in
the review and decision process.

### Review

If a report doesn't contain enough information, the reviewers will strive to obtain all relevant data before acting.

The reviewers will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

- What happened.
- Whether this event constitutes a [Code of Conduct][coc] violation.
- Who, if anyone, was involved in the violation.
- Whether this is an ongoing situation.

The reviewers should aim to have a resolution agreed very rapidly; if not agreed within a week, they will inform the
